# Language

Shared vocabulary for every suggestion this skill makes. Use these terms exactly — don't substitute "component," "service," "API," or "boundary." Consistent language is the whole point.

## Terms

**Module**
Anything with an interface and an implementation. Deliberately scale-agnostic — applies equally to a function, class, package, or tier-spanning slice.
_Avoid_: unit, component, service.

**Interface**
Everything a caller must know to use the module correctly. Includes the type signature, but also invariants, ordering constraints, error modes, required configuration, and performance characteristics.
_Avoid_: API, signature (too narrow — those refer only to the type-level surface).

**Implementation**
What's inside a module — its body of code. Distinct from **Adapter**: a thing can be a small adapter with a large implementation (a Postgres repo) or a large adapter with a small implementation (an in-memory fake). Reach for "adapter" when the seam is the topic; "implementation" otherwise.

**Depth**
Leverage at the interface — the amount of behaviour a caller (or test) can exercise per unit of interface they have to learn. A module is **deep** when a large amount of behaviour sits behind a small interface. A module is **shallow** when the interface is nearly as complex as the implementation.

**Seam** _(from Michael Feathers)_
A place where you can alter behaviour without editing in that place. The *location* at which a module's interface lives. Choosing where to put the seam is its own design decision, distinct from what goes behind it.
_Avoid_: boundary (overloaded with DDD's bounded context).

**Adapter**
A concrete thing that satisfies an interface at a seam. Describes *role* (what slot it fills), not substance (what's inside).

**Leverage**
What callers get from depth. More capability per unit of interface they have to learn. One implementation pays back across N call sites and M tests.

**Locality**
What maintainers get from depth. Change, bugs, knowledge, and verification concentrate at one place rather than spreading across callers. Fix once, fixed everywhere.

## Principles

- **Depth is a property of the interface, not the implementation.** A deep module can be internally composed of small, mockable, swappable parts — they just aren't part of the interface. A module can have **internal seams** (private to its implementation, used by its own tests) as well as the **external seam** at its interface.
- **The deletion test.** Imagine deleting the module. If complexity vanishes, the module wasn't hiding anything (it was a pass-through). If complexity reappears across N callers, the module was earning its keep.
- **The interface is the test surface.** Callers and tests cross the same seam. If you want to test *past* the interface, the module is probably the wrong shape.
- **One adapter means a hypothetical seam. Two adapters means a real one.** Don't introduce a seam unless something actually varies across it.

## Dependency categories (for deepening candidates)

When proposing a deepening, classify what the module depends on. This determines the testing strategy.

**1. In-process** — pure computation, in-memory state, no I/O. Always deepenable. Merge the modules and test through the new interface directly. No adapter needed.

**2. Local-substitutable** — dependencies with local test stand-ins (PGLite for Postgres, in-memory filesystem). Deepenable if the stand-in exists. Tests use the stand-in; seam is internal, not at the module's external interface.

**3. Ports-and-adapters** — your own services across a network boundary (microservices, internal APIs). Define a **port** at the seam. The deep module owns the logic; the transport is injected as an **adapter**. Tests use an in-memory adapter; production uses HTTP/gRPC/queue. Justified when the port has at least two real adapters (test + prod).

**4. Mock** — true external services (Stripe, Twilio, etc.) you don't control. The deepened module takes the dependency as an injected port; tests provide a mock adapter.

## Testing strategy: replace, don't layer

- Old unit tests on shallow modules become waste once tests at the deepened module's interface exist — delete them.
- Write new tests at the deepened module's interface. The **interface is the test surface**.
- Tests assert on observable outcomes through the interface, not internal state.
- Tests should survive internal refactors. If a test has to change when the implementation changes, it's testing past the interface.

## Relationships

- A **Module** has exactly one **Interface** (the surface it presents to callers and tests).
- **Depth** is a property of a **Module**, measured against its **Interface**.
- A **Seam** is where a **Module**'s **Interface** lives.
- An **Adapter** sits at a **Seam** and satisfies the **Interface**.
- **Depth** produces **Leverage** for callers and **Locality** for maintainers.

## Rejected framings

- **Depth as ratio of implementation-lines to interface-lines** (Ousterhout): rewards padding the implementation. We use depth-as-leverage instead.
- **"Interface" as the TypeScript `interface` keyword or a class's public methods**: too narrow — interface here includes every fact a caller must know.
- **"Boundary"**: overloaded with DDD's bounded context. Say **seam** or **interface**.

## Phrasings that fit the style

- "Order intake module is shallow — interface nearly matches the implementation."
- "Pricing leaks across the seam."
- "Deepen: one interface, one place to test."
- "Two adapters justify the seam: HTTP in prod, in-memory in tests."
- "Delete the wrapper — its complexity reappears in one caller, so it wasn't earning its keep."

Wins bullets name the gain in glossary terms: *"locality: bugs concentrate in one module"*, *"leverage: one interface, N call sites"*, *"interface shrinks; implementation absorbs the wrappers"*. Do not write *"easier to maintain"* or *"cleaner code"* — those don't earn their place.
